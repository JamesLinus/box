## Download

Quick Install: `curl -sSL box-builder.sh | sudo bash`

Or [download a release](https://github.com/box-builder/box/releases): Just
`gunzip` the downloaded file and put it in your path:

```bash
$ gunzip box.$(uname -s).gz
$ chmod 755 box.$(uname -s)
$ sudo mv box.$(uname -s) /usr/local/bin/box
```

Alternatively, we have a [homebrew tap](https://github.com/box-builder/homebrew-box)
